    "overview": "Time To Know English is a multi-sensory program for teaching English as a second or a foreign language (ESL/EFL). As a fully balanced literacy curriculum, the curriculum emphasizes the development of reading, writing, listening, speaking, and pronunciation skills. The pedagogical approach of the program is based on the following principles:\n- Learning occurs when students are engaged in experiential activities that encourage them to construct meaning and gain new understandings.\n- A second or foreign language is acquired most successfully when students use language in context for communicative purposes.\n- The spiraling of vocabulary and literacy skills reinforces the material learned and also allows for the teaching of increasingly higher levels of complexity.\n- The learning environment stimulates students to develop 21st century thinking skills rather than simply memorizing data.  \nThe program includes a rich variety of media and texts to offer differentiated stimuli that cater to many levels of interest, proficiency, and learning styles. Various types of scaffolding are provided throughout the content in the form of hints, help, feedback, and narration.\nInteractive language applets are integrated into lessons to help students build understanding and construct meaning.  \nFormative and summative assessments throughout the program facilitate data-driven teaching.",

              "overview": "Integrated into the Reading program are the various skills necessary for building a sound foundation in literacy; the alphabet, phonological awareness, vocabulary, and comprehension. The letters of the English alphabet are taught according to the sound-spelling correspondences through animations that demonstrate shapes, sounds, words, images, and positions on the keyboard. Students practice both perception and production of target sounds to develop accurate pronunciation. At this stage, consonants and vowels are used in words following the consonant-vowel-consonant (CVC) pattern. Stories using the studied letters allow students to succeed in reading aloud and producing the words correctly.\n",

Students complete reading, speaking, listening, vocabulary, and writing activities about the letters “Tt”, “Ii”, and “Pp”, and the sounds that they make. As students learn new letters, they learn to say, read, and understand new words. In the lessons students are also introduced to high frequency words. The unit concludes with an assessment event.",

The letters of the English alphabet are taught according to the sound-spelling correspondences through animations that demonstrate shapes, sounds, words, images, and positions on the keyboard. Students practice both perception and production of target sounds to develop accurate pronunciation. At this stage, consonants and vowels are used in words following the consonant-vowel-consonant (CVC) pattern. Stories using the studied letters allow students to succeed in reading aloud and producing the words correctly.\n",

          "overview": "Time To Know English is a multi-sensory program for teaching English as a second or a foreign language (ESL/EFL). As a fully balanced literacy curriculum, the curriculum emphasizes the development of reading, writing, listening, speaking, and pronunciation skills. The pedagogical approach of the program is based on the following principles:\n- Learning occurs when students are engaged in experiential activities that encourage them to construct meaning and gain new understandings.\n- A second or foreign language is acquired most successfully when students use language in context for communicative purposes.\n- The spiraling of vocabulary and literacy skills reinforces the material learned and also allows for the teaching of increasingly higher levels of complexity.\n- The learning environment stimulates students to develop 21st century thinking skills rather than simply memorizing data.  \nThe program includes a rich variety of media and texts to offer differentiated stimuli that cater to many levels of interest, proficiency, and learning styles. Various types of scaffolding are provided throughout the content in the form of hints, help, feedback, and narration.\nInteractive language applets are integrated into lessons to help students build understanding and construct meaning.  \nFormative and summative assessments throughout the program facilitate data-driven teaching.",
